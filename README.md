## Scripts

### Data Distribution

The `Data_Distribution.py` script generates random data and visualizes data distribution using histograms.

### Linear Regression

The `Linear_Regression.py` script demonstrates linear regression using random data points, including predicting future values.

### Percentiles

The `Percentiles.py` script showcases the concept of percentiles using different datasets.

### Scatter Plots

The `Scatter_Plots.py` script creates scatter plots using age and speed data.

### Standard Deviation and Variance

The `Standard_Deviation_Variance.py` script calculates and explains standard deviation and variance.

### Mean, Median, and Mode

The `Mean_Median_Mode.py` script calculates and explains mean, median, and mode for a given dataset.

Feel free to explore each script for detailed explanations and code comments.
